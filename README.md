[![Agile Manifesto](https://img.youtube.com/vi/hwtCxEMYIdk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwtCxEMYIdk)

the task board
- should change the `tasks` array, that currently contains task description strings, to instead contain task objects that contain a `description` and a `status` property _(the `task` status can be set to any one of the three statuses: `todo`, `doing`, or `done`)_
- should display the same before and after each task is encapsulated in objects

Building toward CSTA Standards:
- Develop programs for multiple computing platforms. (3B-AP-19) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
- Construct solutions to problems using student-created components, such as procedures, modules and/or objects. (3B-AP-14) https://www.csteachers.org/page/standards
